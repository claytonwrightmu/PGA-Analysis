**Setting up a virtual world of golf to compare to live events.**
##
Concept:
Turn the PGA Tour into a video game dashboard using a mathematically grounded Overall Rating system based on strokes-gained analytics. This becomes the backbone for rankings, simulations, course-fit models, and game-like features.
##
**Core**
Create an NBA2K/Madden-style 0–99 Overall Rating for every golfer based on your custom TalentScore, which blends:

- True talent (mu)
- Component skill ratings (OTT, APP, ARG, PUTT)
- Volatility (sigma)
##
System
- More accurate than the OWGR
- More transparent than DataGolf
- More entertaining than traditional analytics
##
Ratings
- Best TalentScore → 99 OVR
- Worst TalentScore → 60 OVR (editable)
- Everyone else scaled proportionally between them
##
Gamify

A) Ryder Cup Team Builder
Use OVR + course fit + form boosts to create:
- Simulated team chemistry
- Matchup probabilities
- Optimal lineup strategies

B) Course DNA Modifiers
Every course adds:
- +APP rating for ball-striker venues
- +ARG for tough greens
- –OTT at positional tracks
Then OVR adjusts accordingly (like “+3 OVR at Augusta”).

C) Player Cards
- Each golfer becomes a “card” with:
- 2K OVR
- Sub-ratings (OTT, APP, ARG, PUTT)

Unique boosts (wind player, bomber, elite scrambler)

D) Tournament Sim Engine
- Use the OVR + volatility (sigma) to simulate:
- Leaderboards
- Upsets
