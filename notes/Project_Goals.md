# Project Goals – PGA-Analysis

This file is a running outline of what I want this project to become and what I’m actively building toward. It should keep me honest when I’m coding, and give future me a clear picture of what the plan was.

---

## 1. Big Picture

Build a golf analytics system that:

- Uses multi-season data
- Produces a true skill rating for every player  
- Understands how different courses reward different styles  
- Can eventually simulate tournaments and "what if" scenarios (ball rollback, different fields, ryder cup rosters)

This isn’t just about getting answers. It’s about building a framework I can keep improving as technology and aritical intelligence advances.

---

## 2. Current Focus

Right now the priorities are:

- Stabilize the **multi-year talent model** (TSS)  
- Make sure the data pipeline is clean for 2023–2025  
- Keep the code organized so it’s easy to add new tools later  
- Start thinking clearly about what inputs are needed for “course DNA”


---

## 3. 1–3 Month Targets

Short to medium term, I want to:

1. Define a first version of Course DNA (what stats actually matter for different layouts)
2. Build a simple script or notebook that ranks players by course fit for a single event 
3. Have encouraging prediction data from The American Express and Farmers Insurance Open
       - Early season tournaments may not show accurate + sustainable data
4. Start drafting how a basic simulation engine would work (inputs → process → outputs)

These don’t have to be perfect, just real.

## 4. Guardrails for the Project

A few steps I follow during the project process:

- Always know what a model is actually using under the hood  
- If something is confusing to understand, simplify it using artifical intelligence
- Keep everything reproducible: raw → processed → model → results

This project should make me better at thinking, not just better at coding.

## 5. Future Ideas

Stuff I’m not doing yet, but want on the radar:

- Archetype clusters (bombers, precision guys, short-game specialists, etc.)  
- Visual dashboards for player profiles and course profiles  
- Automated reports for big events (majors, Ryder Cup, etc.)
- Implement agentic AI
- Add a system to incorporate golfers' personal lives into on course performance (Agent)
- Grade caddies and have a way to track movement in the caddy field (Agent)
- Identify advantageous odds in gambling books (Agent)
- Aging curves for players across seasons
