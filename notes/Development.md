# Dev Notes – PGA-Analysis

This is where I track my own progress, frustrations, and what I’m actually learning while building this thing.
---

## What I Want Out of This For Myself

- Get comfortable working inside a real codebase 
- Understand modeling decisions instead of copying random formulas 
- Build something I’d be confident showing to a recruiter

---

## Current Skills I’m Building

- Drawing data through personal research and recorded stats
- Using **pandas** to merge, clean, and reshape messy sports data
- Terms of **pipelines**: raw → processed → model inputs
- Run simulations with **github**, **codespaces**, **terminal**

---

## Ongoing Reminders

- Confusion is normal when the project gets more complex
- Small, consistent progress beats trying to fix everything in one night.  

---

## Recent Wins

- Got multi-year data into the project without breaking everything  
- Cleaned the active player pool so the dataset makes sense  
- Set up a talent engine that doesn’t just rely on one season
