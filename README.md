# PGA-Analysis
This analysis gives insight into PGA tour dstance and accuracy data, player-course fit, potential ryder cup rosters, the golf ball rollback impact, and more. This project allows me to explore personal interests and apply it to real world data sets. It is my first project on GitHub and I'm excited to learn as I go.
