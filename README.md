# PGA-Analysis
PGA Tour Analytics Project
- This analysis gives insight into PGA tour dstance and accuracy data, player-course fit, potential ryder cup rosters, the golf ball rollback impact, and more. This project allows me to explore personal interests and apply it to real world data sets. It is my first project on GitHub and I'm excited to learn as I go.

## Overview
I’m analyzing PGA Tour data to understand:
- Distance vs accuracy and how they affect scoring
- Player–course fit on different types of tracks
- Potential Ryder Cup roster construction
- Impact of the golf ball rollback on different player types

## Status
- Current focus: collecting valuable data and expanding knowledge on coding
- Tech stack: Python, pandas, Jupyter (planned)

## Goals
- Build a reusable dataset of player and course stats
- Create models to predict performance on specific courses
- Simulate different Ryder Cup roster scenarios
- Model “what if” outcomes under ball rollback rules
- Learn
